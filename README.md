## Security:
The use of an SQLite database brings with it some security flaws and vulnerabillites. To address these concerns and enhance the security of the data being stored, a mitigation approach has been adopted, which involves encrypting all data being stored by using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

## Future Developments
The next stage of development is to intergrate a PostgreSQL database and deploy to and EC2 instance on AWS.
